# Bingo

![Main Screen](/img/main.png)

I originally developed a Bingo program in 2013 for my daughter's elementary school. At the time, they were using a cheap store-bought case and cardboard cards to hold the balls. As is common with these games, the balls often ended up rolling around the floor, causing the caller to search for them after they were dropped.

I wanted a system similar to what larger Bingo halls have, featuring a way to see which balls have been called, the last ball called, the next ball to be called, and information about the current games being played.

The program I wrote in 2013 was designed in Visual Basic .NET (2010). It included some extra tools, such as the ability to print your own cards. However, since pre-printed Bingo cards are cheaper than printing the cards yourself, I removed this feature in the latest version.
